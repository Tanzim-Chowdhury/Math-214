This repository has a C++ program implemented to find the best move to make for a tic-tac-toe player given
the current state of the board. The program is currently intended to only take the board shown in the
main function, but the implementation can be changed such that user input is also supported. The minimax
function in the program could also be applied to programming an AI that plays tic-tac-toe, in order to
make the best moves possible on the gaming board. The linear programming application comes from the minimax
algorithm when traversing the game board and making recursive calls to minimax in order to determine
the best move to make.
